Still sketch. Mixin to add the ability to track changes of an object, to reflect changes in a data structure and to make possible to apply the changes to another object. Use the module to mirror object's changes somehow elsewhere, for example on server-side or client-side.

### Try out
```
npm install
node sample/Sample.s
```
